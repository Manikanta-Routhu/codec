OVERVIEW

The movie recommendation system helps users discover movies similar to their favorites. By selecting a movie from the list, users receive a list of top 10 recommended movies along with their posters. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze the features of movies and find similarities between them. It uses the TMDB API to fetch and display movie posters, enhancing the user experience by providing visual context for the recommendations. The system is built with Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to explore movie recommendations easily.
